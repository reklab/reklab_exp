function varargout = CUID_DataSet(varargin)
% $Revision: 1.3 $
% CUID_DATASET M-file for CUID_DataSet.fig
%      CUID_DATASET, by itself, creates a new CUID_DATASET or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = CUID_DATASET returns the handle to a new CUID_DATASET or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      CUID_DATASET('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in CUID_DATASET.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      CUID_DATASET('Property','Value',...) creates a new CUID_DATASET or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before CUID_DataSet_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to CUID_DataSet_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
